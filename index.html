Afterward, over Chinese takeout, he tried to ingratiate himself with the crew by assuring them that their victim “got what he deserved.”</span></p>
          <p>He was 13 years old. Growing up in a “pretty good family,” he knew it was wrong to shoot a man. Still, he said, “I really didn’t feel any remorse or anything.” What he did feel was that his crew had a "newfound respect” for him.</p>
          <p>By 14, he was the one doing the shooting. Over time, he learned to do it well. He used 9mm guns that held 16 bullets and Mac-10 submachine guns with extended clips. He lured victims to his turf, where he could scout for witnesses and surveillance cameras, in what he called his “Miranda check” -- a macabre reference to the right to remain silent.</p>
          <p>He also knew where to aim.</p>

          <p>“If I shoot you in the leg, I know what I’m going to get,” he said. “If I shoot you in the stomach, I know what I’m going to get. If I shoot you in the head, I definitely know what I’m going to get. I’m going to get your demise.” </p>
          <p>Covington’s evolution encapsulates a larger trend driving gun violence around the country -- increasingly, people are shooting to kill. In Baltimore, one of every three people struck by gunfire dies. That means it ranks as the most lethal of America’s largest cities, according to a Baltimore Sun analysis.</p>
          <p>Two other cities -- Washington, D.C., and New Orleans -- shared the brutal distinction of a one-in-three gun homicide rate in 2015. Several cities have seen the death grip tighten. In Chicago, one in 10 people died after being shot in 2000; now one in five perish.                   </p>
          <p>Last year turned particularly lethal -- the odds for gunshot victims worsened in 10 of the nation’s largest cities, The Sun found in a review of available data. </p>
          <p>On the streets, cities are witnessing more lethal tactics. Police and hospitals are reporting surges in head shots and victims who have been shot repeatedly. Criminals are stockpiling higher-caliber guns, many with extended gun magazines that hold dozens of bullets. And trauma doctors are finding it more difficult to save gunshot victims.</p>
          <p>The result: In many places, if you get shot, you are more likely to die than ever before.</p>

          <p>The Baltimore Sun documented these patterns of lethality in a yearlong investigation based on available crime statistics, hospital data and gun trace reports as well as interviews with police chiefs, homicide detectives, criminologists, epidemiologists, community activists, victims of gun violence and the perpetrators themselves.</p>
          <p>Historically, gun violence research in the U.S. has been inhibited by a lack of federal funding and data -- many police departments only track what they are required to report to the FBI each year, which doesn’t include include how often people survive shootings, where on the body people are shot and how many times.</p>
          <p>That has led to a focus on annual body counts and homicide rates, which can be traced back nearly a century, and left criminologists to puzzle over the causes behind spikes and dips.  </p>
          <p>Over the past two years, a number of cities -- Baltimore, Chicago, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Washington -- have been gripped by a steep increase in shootings and homicides. Deteriorating police-community relations have been blamed, as have gang conflicts and entrenched societal ills such as segregation, poverty and joblessness.</p>
          <p>While all these factors play a role in driving violence across the nation -- as they have for years, if not decades -- a city’s homicide rate typically fluctuates, sometimes significantly. Just five years ago, Baltimore public officials were celebrating a drop in the annual homicide count below 200. This year, that marker was crossed in August.</p>
          <p>But one trend has been constant: Lethal force has become more so.</p>

          <p>More shooters are aiming for the head and firing multiple rounds into victims. In Baltimore, roughly two-thirds of homicide victims are either shot in the head or multiple times. Many suffer both fates.</p>
          <p>Head shots have increased fivefold in the city over the past two decades, to more than 60 percent of victims. And the number of bodies with XX or more bullets has XX in the past decade, according to the Maryland medical examiner’s office, which tallied the grim statistic at the request of The Sun.</p>
          <p>Guns also have become more deadly, as the weapon of choice for criminals and then law enforcement shifted from the revolver to the semi-automatic. Nationally, the number of 9mm and .40-caliber guns taken off the streets surged over the past four years, as seizures of the less powerful .22-caliber guns remained relatively flat.</p>
          <p>In Maryland last year, seizures of 9mm handguns overtook .22-caliber guns for the first time since statistics started being kept a few years ago. Most were on Baltimore’s streets, where the saying goes: “Buy every gun that comes through; don’t let it be the gun that kills you.”</p>
          <p>Many of the guns are equipped with extended magazines, allowing a shooter to fire from a distance and “walk down” a victim, continuously firing. Banned in Maryland, where clips are limited to 10 rounds, these “extendos” are prized in street cultures where long magazines are tucked under belts and into pants as a fashion statement.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier, who is retiring this month after more than a decade in Washington, D.C., keeps a photo of a 100-round magazine seized by police on her cellphone as a reminder of the firepower out there.</p>
          <p>Law enforcement officials across the country also say they’ve observed more insidious circumstances that are difficult to quantify. Reckless shootings in the daytime. Vigilante justice and contract killers. Gang rules that codify when violence should be used -- and street rules that limited violence against innocent bystanders being broken.</p>
          <p>While shooter motives vary, experts and those caught in the crossfire note a ruthlessness on the streets where hardened criminals with more sophisticated weaponry aren’t just using guns to intimidate rivals or carry out robberies. They are using them to take people out.</p>
          <p>“It’s very common for someone to walk up and empty a pistol at close range,” said criminologist David M. Kennedy, describing the “extreme” gang mindset in cities like Baltimore, Washington and New Orleans. “It’s organization, it’s a street ethos, it’s very likely retaliation. It’s going in with a heightened intent to actually kill you.”</p>
          <p>Guns are stashed in trash cans, hung from gutter grates by a string and stashed in other nooks around cities where they can be quickly recovered when needed. (Covington says he kept part of his arsenal under an apartment complex’s washing machine.)</p>
          <p>Or young men with clean records are serving as “human holsters” for felons, according to Milwaukee Police Chief Edward A. Flynn.</p>
          <p>In Baltimore, police are tracking the so-called 10 Grand Club, an organized gang of hitmen willing to kill for that price, and prosecutors say that’s double the typical fee. (Covington became a contract killer but also says he “killed out of friendship” for free if a woman approached him about taking out her rapist or her child’s molester.)</p>
          <p>Not even decades of advancements in trauma medicine can stem the carnage.</p>
          <p>Gunshot victims have seen their chances of survival plummet, even as patients with major injuries from other assaults and car accidents have seen their chances improve dramatically. Studies by hospitals and trauma centers across the country, including Baltimore’s top-ranked medical systems, have documented this contrarian trend.</p>
          <p>“We feel this represents a true change in violence intensity,” Johns Hopkins Hospital researchers concluded.</p>
          <p>This has left communities nationwide reeling, with violence concentrated in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods where mothers are forming support groups, not only to help each other cope but in a desperate search for ways to stop the killing. A nationwide network of grief is starting to form.</p>
          <p>“We’re all facing similar dynamics,” said Corneilius Scott, who volunteers as executive director of Mothers of Murdered Sons and Daughters in Baltimore. “There’s a lot of concern and not many answers.”</p>
          <p>At the group’s meetings, parents are talking about “sensitizing” young men to the effects of violence. They believe -- and social science is finding -- that their boys need to be taught empathy, lest they become trapped in a cycle, repeatedly exposed to violence and becoming more likely to commit it.</p>

            <div class="article__chapter-title__text">CHAPTER TITLE</div>
          </div>
          <p>Rodney Chase sensed trouble when three young men approached him on Gay Street in Baltimore, but he didn’t run, saying he’s not the kind to back down from anyone. One of the men pulled a gun; they wanted his NFL Starter jacket, his wallet, anything of value.</p>
          <p>As Chase took off his jacket, one of the men tried to yank it off, and Chase instinctively hit him. The gunman fired into Chase’s belly, and Chase felt as if hot grease had been thrown at him.	</p>
          <p>A woman nearby screamed and called an ambulance. He underwent surgery. Doctors put in a screen under his skin to hold in his organs. He wasn’t discharged for nearly two months. All from a .22 caliber gun.</p>
          <p>“Luckily it was a .22,” he said recently, lifting his shirt to show off a scar slicing down the middle of his stomach. “I’m grateful for that. If it was bigger, I’d be done.”</p>
          <p>That was more than two decades ago. Had he been shot nowadays, with the kinds of guns prevalent on Baltimore’s streets, he believes he’d be dead.</p>
          <p>He knows Baltimore’s streets because that’s where he’s spent most of his life. He was a drug addict living in an abandoned house earlier this year when he was seriously injured in a knife attack and ended up at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center. He also was admitted into a hospital program that connects patients with social services in hopes of reducing the recidivism of violence.</p>
          <p>“I call it ‘Clip City,’” Chase said of Baltimore. “What they got now -- they’re death dealers. And it’s not hard to get ‘em.</p>
          <p>Gun production in the U.S. set a blistering pace in recent years.</p>
          <p>The manufacturing of pistols, revolvers, rifles and shotguns has grown steadily since 2008, to 10.8 million in 2013 and more than 9 million firearms in 2014, according to the the latest data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p>
          <p>That’s double and triple the annual pace of manufacturing in the previous 20 years.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the guns sold now are more powerful. They are higher caliber weapons, discharge bullets at faster speeds and come with larger magazines. </p>
          <p>“All of these factors, over the last several decades, have progressed,” said Jay Wachtel, a 20-year ATF agent who is now a professor of criminal justice at California State University at Fullerton. That has led to what he called an “incredible increase in the lethality of guns.”</p>
          <p>Even an inexperienced shooter, Wachtel said, can do a lot of damage with a high-caliber semiautomatic gun, which can fire more bullets without reloading than a revolver. “You don’t need to be a very good shot because any organs nearby are going to be pulverized,” he said.</p>
          <p>Gun experts have wondered about the reasons driving sales. Some say fear of stricter gun control is stoking demand; others say law-abiding citizens are arming themselves in the wake of mass shootings.</p>
          <figure class="inline-media inline-media--pic inline-media--full" data-sr><img src="dist/images/ex1.jpg">

          </figure>
          <p>Eventually, though, many of those guns end up on the streets despite state and national laws aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of felons. Law enforcement officials in cities nationwide say they have seen an increase in the quality of guns wielded by criminals.</p>
          <p>“All the cheap guns made in the 80’s have either quit functioning or have been recovered by police,” said Los Angeles Homicide Det. John Skaggs, the protagonist in the best-selling book “Ghettoside” for his determination to solve homicide cases. “They seem to all be expensive and high-quality now.”</p>
          <p>In Milwaukee, police are tracking this trend.</p>
          <p>In 2006, the top three guns seized by police there were the Hi-Point 9 mm and .380 pistols that cost less than $200 and have standard magazines that hold eight bullets as well as the Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun that sells for about $320.</p>
          <p>About halfway through 2016, the most seized gun was the the Smith & Wesson .40-caliber pistol that costs more than $400 and comes with a magazine that holds as many as 16 rounds, followed by the Smith & Wesson 9 mm pistol and the Glock .40-caliber handgun -- both of which sell for more than $500 and have standard magazines that hold nine to 15 bullets.</p>
          <p>“The gun of choice of street offenders has shifted over time to higher quality, higher caliber of semiautomatic pistols,” said Kennedy, the criminologist who directs the National Network for Safe Communities, a project of John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. “Since those are the guns that gangs and drug-involved offenders are more likely to have, they’re more likely to kill somebody.”</p>
          <p>Flynn, Milwaukee’s police chief, said most of the guns used in crime -- nearly 90 percent -- are bought legally. He blamed “straw purchases,” in which someone with a clean criminal record buys the gun for felons who are banned from owning a firearm, as well as street sales.</p>
          <p>He said the average time from when a gun is purchased to when it is recovered by law enforcement dropped from 10.6 years in 2012 to 8.6 years in 2014, indicating a quicker pace at which guns are trickling into the hands of criminals.</p>
          <p>“Everyone assumes they’re stealing the guns,” Flynn said. “They're buying them legally.”</p>
          <p>In Baltimore, the once-ubiquitous “Saturday night specials” -- cheaply made 22- or .25-caliber handguns that were banned for a time in Maryland -- are no longer as prevalent.</p>
          <p>Now 9mm guns are the top gun seized by police, and the Glock .40 caliber was most often used in crimes last year. Those weapons are capable of firing a bullet nearly twice the diameter of the original Saturday Night Special.</p>
          <p>“A lot of big guns out there,” said James “J.T. Timpson, a community liaison officer with Safe Streets, the city’s violence mediation program that works in high-crime neighborhoods to resolve conflicts without police intervention. “We don’t have .22s no more.”</p>
          <p>Timpson said shooters believe they need “stopping power” to ensure their mark is dead -- and can’t retaliate.</p>

          <p>Measures aimed at limiting high-capacity magazines haven’t kept them off the streets, either.</p>
          <p>The 1994 federal assault weapons ban, which expired in 2003, restricted magazines to no more than 10 rounds of ammunition. As Congress grappled with whether to renew the law, the Department of Justice studied its effectiveness.</p>
          <p>The researchers focused in part on Baltimore, which has kept a wider range of crime data than other cities. During the ban, they found no decline in the number of guns with extended magazines being used in violent crimes in the city, including homicides, shootings, robberies and other assaults.</p>
          <p>Maryland again restricted the number of bullets guns can carry when lawmakers passed one of the nation’s strictest gun control laws in 2013. The law, which regulates certain gun purchases, also prohibits the sale and possession of detachable magazines of more than 10 rounds.</p>
          <p>Since the law passed, however, dozens of “extendos” have been confiscated in the city. Baltimore gun seizures are up XXX, but police don’t track the capacity of magazines on guns they’ve recovered.</p>
          <p>As for the law’s effectiveness, that’s difficult to track. Only 11 people have been charged in Baltimore under the magazine statute. One possible reason: It’s still legal to possess large-capacity magazines if they were purchased outside the state.</p>
          <p>The penalties under the law are stiff. If convicted of committing a felony or violent crime with an extended magazine, defendants face a minimum of five years in prison and a maximum of 20. </p>
          <p>In neighboring D.C., where gun seizures by police are up nearly 50 percent this year over last, police noticed more rounds being shot at scenes, from multiple shooters, and with high-capacity magazines. So they began keeping statistics.</p>
          <p>Last year, about one-third of guns recovered had high-capacity magazines. Through June of this year, nearly half had large clips. </p>
          <p>At the same time, after years of steep declines in the nation’s violent crime rate, homicides spiked in Washington, Baltimore and more than half of the largest American cities last year. That higher pace has continued in MANY? cities this year.</p>
          <p>Former D.C. Chief Lanier, who worked with police chiefs across the U.S., sharing ideas and data, said it’s clear from what she’s seen in Washington and what she’s heard from her counterparts in other cities that shootings are becoming more lethal.</p>
          <p>According to an analysis by The Sun, the odds for gunshot victims worsened last year in a number of cities including Washington as well as Detroit, Louisville, Charlotte and San Francisco. In New York, one in five shooting victims died last year, up from one in seven in 2014. In Nashville, the odds of dying increased from one in nine shootings in 2014 to one to four last year.</p>

          <p>That surprised XXX researcher from Harvard University, who said he would have thought as the number of shootings surged, the rate at which people died would decline.</p>
          <p>This lethality rate is an overlooked aspect of the homicide equation that researchers say they’d like to explore but are hampered by a paucity of statistics. The Sun reviewed statistics from half of the 30 largest cities; police departments in the other cities don’t track the data, making a nationwide analysis impossible.</p>
          <p>Researchers said lethality is a significant piece of the puzzle, with implications for policing, public health and trauma care.</p>
          <p>Lanier blames the pernicious state of cities on the brazen nature of some of the attacks. Criminals are emptying their clips, she said, leaving crime scenes littered with 50 to 60 shell casings, and opening fire in the daytime.</p>
          <p>“Something’s changed in the mentality of the people shooting,” Lanier said. “Very reckless. Everyone’s got a gun, and everyone is willing to do these shootouts.”</p>

<span>CHAPTER 3</span>

            <div class="article__chapter-title__text">CHAPTER TITLE</div>
          </div>
          <p>The first bullet ripped into his thigh, and he crumpled.</p>
          <p>Devante Fordbey dropped to the asphalt on a spring day two years ago, when he turned and saw his assailant in a hoodie pointing what looked like a .9mm. The gun was jammed, and Devante began pulling himself up the street on his elbows and forearms as quick as he could. Then he heard the next shot blast.</p>
          <p>Now the bullets felt like hammer blows. The more the shooter closed in, the more he felt the force of the bullets moving at more than 900 feet per second. Fordbey turned onto his back and put his hands up.</p>
          <p>“You’re good, you’re good!” Fordbey yelled. “You got me!”</p>
          <p>But the shots kept coming. A bullet pierced his inner left pectoral muscle. Nine sunk into his right thigh. One just missed his heart, striking his chest where the words “Nana” for his grandmother are tattooed along with some clouds and doves.</p>
          <p>Figuring he was going to die, he began to taunt the shooter. “You’re a bitch.”</p>
          <p>Then a slug sliced into his head, and he blacked out just as he saw the man run away. He figures his survival instinct must have taken over, and he came to as he was trying to crawl away again.</p>
          <p>“He heard me shuffling on the ground, and I’m trying to get myself off the ground,” Fordbey said. “He came right back and slapped in another clip in the gun. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. … I blacked out.”</p>
          <p>In and out from consciousness he went, while his mother dug out the slug from his skull and pressed her hand against his neck to stop the bleeding. She lived nearby and came running when word reached her.</p>
          <p>“I’m sorry ma. I’m sorry ma. I feel myself leaving, I feel it,” he told her.</p>
          <p>As a paramedic called his name in the racing ambulance, he thought it was God. “Devante! Devante! Devante!”</p>
          <p>With advancements in trauma medicine over decades, emergency room patients now have a better chance of surviving than ever before. Patients who have been stabbed are more likely to live. Better care coupled with safety advancements have driven deaths from motor vehicle accidents to historic lows.</p>
          <p>Gunshot victims, however, are less likely to live.</p>
          <p>In Baltimore, at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, the nation’s first hospital devoted to trauma injuries, doctors sought to assess improvements in care. They studied patients over a dozen years and found that chances for surviving “improved significantly.”</p>
          <p>A notable exception: gunshot victims. In 1999, 9.8 percent of those patients died. By 2008, that rate had risen to 17 percent.</p>
          <p>The study’s authors, including Thomas Scalea, the physician-in-chief at center, blamed the increasing availability of lethal automatic and semiautomatic weapons on the street. Today, Scalea says that trend has continued. The trauma surgeon is seeing more “higher velocity injuries” from high-caliber guns and more bullet wounds per patient.</p>
          <p>Johns Hopkins Hospital also studied trauma outcomes and found that the fatality rate for patients with gunshot wounds rose from 9.5 percent between 2000 and 2003 to 18.3 percent for the period through March 2005.</p>
          <p>And most of them died in the emergency room. For those patients doctors and nurses were able to stabilize and move out of the trauma bays, the fatality rate remained stable at 5 percent during both periods. The study concluded that the overall fatality rate jumped because more patients were arriving in grave shape.</p>
          <p>More patients were dead on arrival, and more succumbed to their injuries within minutes of arriving at the hospital. The median time before they were pronounced dead: six minutes.</p>
          <p>The researchers also noted another grim statistic: About half of patients were shot in the head, and the already slim chance of survival for those patients narrowed over time. In fact, the researchers at one of the nation’s most respected medical institutions concluded there was little they could do.</p>
          <p>“The only way to save these patients is to reach out to them in the community before they are victims of violence,” the study concluded.</p>

          <p>On the streets, gunmen were increasingly aiming the head. It has been a clear, long-term trend in Baltimore, with the number of fatal head shots rising steadily from about 13 percent of homicide victims in 1994 to 62 percent last year.</p>
          <p>Some criminals are cunning enough to know that more of their targets are wearing body armor, said Baltimore police Maj. Donald Bauer. And In a cruel twist, some shooters are taking into account that Baltimore has top-notch trauma care, said former police commissioner Anthony Batts. That’s why they aim for the head -- to “take the trauma center out of the equation.”</p>
          <p>“When they’re trying to take someone out, they shoot them in the head,” said Batts, now a consultant with the AWW Group training police commanders.</p>
          <p>Gunmen also were increasingly pumping bullets into victims. People shot multiple times made up less than 60 percent of homicide victims in 2005, the earliest year for which data is available. That rose to 70 percent by last year.</p>
          <p>The Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner recently studied homicide autopsy reports of gunshot victims dating to 2005. About one-third of the victims died from a single gunshot, and that remained constant over the past decade. But when victims were shot multiple times, the number of bullets per cadaver steadily increased from 4.7 in 2005 to 5.7 last year.</p>
          <p>“I never get a single gunshot wound -- never,” said Sue Carol Verrillo, nurse manager of the surgical inpatient care unit at Johns Hopkins Hospital.</p>
          <p>Hospitals and medical schools across the nation have witnessed the same trends -- the severity of wounds and the sheer number of them increase year by year. </p>
          <p>Angela Sauaia, professor of public health, medicine, and surgery at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, was among a team of researchers that recently completed a study of patients at a Denver trauma hospital, comparing chances of survival from various injuries.</p>
          <p>Again, they found that gunshot victims stood out for falling behind. Their fatality rate jumped 6 percent -- every two years. When patients were taken to Denver Health Medical Center, survival rates didn’t improve at all during the time period studied -- 13 years, starting in 2000.</p>
          <p>“There are more injuries to treat so no wonder the case fatality is increasing,” Sauaia said. “That was not the norm 10 years ago.”</p>
          <p>Doctors couldn’t keep up with the increasing trauma. “We do know there are more bullets, and the injuries of each bullet are more serious,” she said. “The holes are bigger.”</p>
          <p>In Newark, New Jersey, researchers were seeing the same. Over a dozen years through 2011 at the New Jersey Trauma Center at University Hospital, the percentage of patients with three or more wounds doubled, as did those with injuries to three or more body regions. The incidence of brain and spinal cord injuries almost doubled.</p>
          <p>Researchers also noted more gunshot victims were arriving at the emergency room in the afternoon and evening, when there was still some daylight left and witnesses were more likely to be awake.</p>
          <p>And again, researchers found, the mortality rate increased.</p>
          <p>Fordbey, now 24, was one of the lucky ones. Shot 27 times, he had been a victim, he says, of “karma” after years of percocet-popping, drug dealing, fights and shootouts.</p>
          <p>He saw his shooter and believes he was targeted by a rival drug crew over turf. Fordbey toyed with the idea of retaliating -- gathering his “boys,” finding the suspect, and shooting him and everyone with him, leaving no witnesses.</p>
          <p>But he says he gave up “the game” to focus on being a father to his four children. He’s re-learned how to walk with extensive physical therapyand keeps the bullet his mother dislodged from his head in a box near his bed.</p>
          <p>Still, he isn’t about to give up his credibility on the streets.</p>
          <p>“I can’t be labeled a snitch. I can’t be labeled a rat, especially in this city,” he said, explaining why he didn’t cooperate with police. “Snitches die.”</p>
          <p>“Code of the streets period,” he added. “Snitches get stitches. I honor the street code -- the G code. I honored it my whole life. I can’t tolerate snitching. I can’t. My body, my mindset won’t let me tell.”</p>
          <p>No one has ever been arrested in his shooting.</p>

            <div class="article__chapter-title__text">CHAPTER TITLE</div>
          </div>
          <p>The “code” has many connotations on Baltimore streets. To some it’s a “gangster” or street code that strictly prohibits snitching to police. To others it’s a set of guidelines for when violence is prohibited -- no shooting near children or the elderly, for instance -- and when violence is warranted, or even required.</p>
          <p>The Black Guerilla Family, Baltimore’s most powerful gang, distributes a typewritten rulebook to members on the streets and in jail cells. The militaristic rules dictate that infractions can lead to punishment, sometimes death, and protocols for carrying out violence, such as no shooting near “religious institutions.”</p>
          <p>Covington, the hitman who says he was an enforcer for the BGF, describes the “golden rules” as nuanced in some ways, clearcut in others.</p>
          <p>You’re never supposed to snitch, even on your enemy, he said. And you’re not supposed to target your enemy’s “law-abiding citizens” -- family members who aren’t in the drug game -- but if those relatives are “in the life,” they can be  targeted.  p Nowadays, however, rules that might have helped to keep a lid on random, collateral violence are regularly broken, according to law enforcement as well as community activists and members.</p>
          <p>Baltimore homicide detective Vernon Parker says shooters are “more bold,” shooting in the daytime near churches, schools and other public places, and getting away with it.</p>
          <p>He cited a case from last year in which a man was kidnapped from his own stoop in full daylight in front of his friends, taken to an alley and shot to death.</p>
          <p>“No one reported it,” Parker said.</p>
          <p>“People more cold-hearted these days than when I was growing up,” said Fordbey, the man who survived 27 shots. “Everybody wants to be a killer.  It’s more killings going on now because everybody feel like they got to prove themselves.</p>
          <p>"Back in the day, I was told, it was like a kind of rule: The old dudes wouldn't allow outsiders to come in the ‘hood, and everybody respected the women and children. Now, it’s like no respect for nothing. People don’t care.”</p>
          <p>The challenge for police is knowing when someone might the trigger. Police departments nationwide have turned to predictive policing to try to understand who might be the next killer, or next on a hit list.</p>
          <p>In Chicago, the “Strategic Subject List” is an algorithm that calculates the propensity” of someone to become a “party” to violence. Someone’s score is based on previous police contacts and criminal activity, known affiliations with gang members, social connections or networks, and past injuries from gunshot or assaults.</p>
          <p>Once a person lands on the list, Chicago police sends them a “notification” of the “consequences that will result should violent activity continue.”</p>
          <p>They make up a fraction of the city’s population but take part in an outsized share of the violence -- in the first three months of this year, more than three-quarters of the shooting victims and homicide suspects were already on the list.</p>
          <p>In Baltimore, a similar undertaking has identified 600 “trigger pullers,” or those police believe are most likely to shoot or be shot.</p>
          <p>In many cities, it’s a select club. Suspects and targets often know each other. They may have been friends, lived on the same the street or even be related. Many are in the drug trade together. That familiarity allows for face-to-face disagreements that can end with a trigger pull.</p>
          <p>“The distance has closed in a lot of these cases, and now they’re up on each other,” said Stanley Brandford, a Baltimore police colonel who has led the homicide unit two times in his career. “These guys stay in these neighborhoods. They really don’t travel very far. And the opportunity to get close and do some damage is prevalent in some of these neighborhoods.”</p>

          <p>Criminals today know to get close to their target and fire a lot of bullets, said Stuart Myers, a former police officer who runs Op-Tac International, which trains law enforcement in Maryland and elsewhere on weapons and tactics. That’s because most criminals aren’t good shots, he said.</p>
          <p>Even police officers, who train and are certified, miss their targets more than they hit them. One study put the average hit rate for officers at less than 30 percent. </p>
          <p>“If you’re close enough to a target, you could close your eyes and pull the trigger,” Myers said. He estimated that range is within three yards. Then, he said: “You will hit your target.”</p>
          <p>Police say a common tactic shooters use to gain proximity is to work work with an accomplice who knows the target. The accomplice lures the target to an area, putting the person at ease to ensure a blind-side.</p>
          <p>In gang parlance, it’s known as “rocking you to sleep.”</p>
          <p>Shooters also are reaching for high-caliber guns with large magazines to ensure they hit their mark, said Dante Barksdale, an outreach coordinator for Safe Streets.</p>
          <p>“The more bullets that they got the safer that they are,” he said. “They know they can’t hit nobody from two blocks away. They got to get up on you.”</p>
          <p>Barksdale knows the streets. He spent eight years in prison for heroin dealing. His uncle is Nathan “Bodie” Barksdale, a legendary Baltimore drug dealer whose life inspired characters in the television show “The Wire.”</p>
          <p>In some neighborhoods, he said friends or drug crews pool money to buy guns, often bought at gun shows or stolen from registered gun owners, and they become shared weapons on a given street corner.</p>
          <p>Adding an extended clip is not only key to survival, “it’s an obsession,” according to Chris Wilson, who started the residential and commercial contracting company Barclay Investment Corp. in Baltimore, working with local agencies? to give ex-offenders jobs and help them start businesses.</p>
          <p>“In the streets when you get a gun, you got to put an extended on it. You got to. That’s policy. You got to be official,” said Wilson, who grew up in Washington, where he dealt drugs and was in more than a dozen shootouts. He was sentenced to life in prison at 17 after he shot and killed a man. He served nearly 15 years.</p>
          <p>In a shootout, it can be a simple matter of math. “A car rolls up, they fire some shots, you fire six or seven back, then they fire shots, you might get pinned down and you have to shoot back to get out of there,” Wilson said. “If you have nine or 10 bullets, you’re out.”</p>
          <p>The larger clips also allow a shooter to “walk you down,” said Timpson, of Safe Streets.</p>
          <p>“If I start further back, that means I have to be more accurate,” he said. “But if I start with an extendo, and I hit you from the corner, I’m going to walk you down. … I can walk you down without ever having to stop firing.”</p>
          <p>Former Baltimore Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez, who has spent nearly 30 years in law enforcement, mostly with the Los Angeles Police Department, said he was struck by the “level of determination” among killers in Baltimore. He noted the high number of head shots.</p>
          <p>“I think there’s a meaning behind that. I think there’s a purpose behind that,” he said. “It’s sending a message, but it’s also making sure the outcome is what they want.”</p>
          <p>Rodriguez, now a consultant to police departments, said he found “a much more personal type of killing in Baltimore” -- a city of 92 square miles -- compared to Los Angeles that sprawls over 470 square miles.</p>
          <p>But even on the West Coast, police have noted a shift in shooting dynamics. In Los Angeles, gangs have often carried out drive-by shootings, which could be indiscriminate and ineffective if the intent is to kill someone in particular.</p>
          <p>Now, they are getting out of the car.   </p>
          <p>“You want to kill ‘em, not wing ‘em,” said LAPD Homicide Det. Chris Barling, describing the mentality of shooters.</p>
